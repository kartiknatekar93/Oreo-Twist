          <p class="main-content">In providing their services, they may access, receive, maintain or otherwise process
            Personal
            Data on our behalf. Our contracts with these service providers do not permit use of your
            information for their own purposes, including their marketing purposes. Consistent with
            applicable legal requirements, we take commercially reasonable steps to require third parties

          <p class="main-content">Partners. We may sometimes offer you a service or application in co-operation with
            partners
            (for example, co-sponsors or licensors, licensees or distributors of our branded products).
            We may therefore need to disclose your Personal Data to those partners. Consistent with
            applicable legal requirements, we take commercially reasonable steps to require third parties
            to adequately safeguard your Personal Data and only process it in accordance with our
            instructions or as co-controllers. In those cases in which the disclosure of your Personal Data
            with third partners takes place based on your consent or your request to do so, where
            relevant, we will clearly notify you of the sharing, and you will have the choice not to
            participate or to otherwise object to such sharing.</p>

            Third parties in case of legal requirement. We may also disclose your Personal Data if
            we believe we are required to do so by law, or that doing so is reasonably necessary to
            comply with legal processes; when we believe necessary or appropriate to disclose Personal
            Data to law enforcement authorities, such as to investigate actual or suspected fraud or
            violations of law, breaches of security, or breaches of this Privacy Notice; to respond to any

          <h2>E. International transfers of your Personal Data</h2>
          <p class="main-content">

          <p class="main-content">
            We also use some third party suppliers to help us provide business services. These third parties may have
            access to or host your Personal Data, but will always do so under our instructions and subject to a
            contractual relationship. When these third parties are located in territories which may not offer an
            equivalent level of protection to privacy as that applicable within your country, we will take reasonable
            steps to verify that your Personal Data receives a reasonable level of protection.
          </p>
          <h2>F. How do we ensure the security of your Personal Data?</h2>

          <p class="main-content">We use a variety of physical, technical and administrative security standards,
            technologies and procedures
            to help protect your Personal Data from loss, misuse, alteration, destruction or damage to an appropriate
            level depending on the sensitivity of the information.</p>
          <p class="main-content">
            We take steps to limit access to your Personal Data to those persons who need to have access to it for one
            of the purposes listed in this Privacy Notice. Furthermore, we use reasonable efforts to ensure that any

            third party processing your Personal Data equally provide for confidentiality and integrity of your data in
            a secure way.
          </p>

            it by reaching

          <h2>H. Social Media, Other Websites, or Online Services</h2>
          <p class="main-content">When you participate in any of our MDLZ profiles or wherever MDLZ is present in any of
            the various
            social media forums like Facebook, Twitter, Yammer, Pinterest, Instagram, LinkedIn, Youtube, etc., you
            should be familiar with and understand the tools provided by those sites that allow you to make choices
            about how you share the Personal Data in your social media profile(s).</p>
          <p class="main-content">For these forums the privacy practices or policies of these third parties apply, so we
            encourage you to
            read the applicable privacy notices, terms of use and related information about how your Personal Data is
            used in these social media environments.</p>
          <p class="main-content">Subsequently our Sites may contain links to third-party websites; if you follow these
            links, you will exit
            our websites and mobile applications. While these third-party websites are selected with care, MDLZ
            cannot accept liability for the use of your Personal Data by these organisations. For more information and
            details, please consult the section on Data Privacy Notices of third parties and the privacy statement of
            the
            website you are visiting (if such a statement is provided).</p>
          <p class="main-content">Except where provided otherwise, this Privacy Notice shall not apply to these social
            media forums and
            third-party websites/applications not owned by MDLZ since they control and process your Personal Data.</p>
          <p class="main-content">Some of our online service providers assist us with online analytics, targeted
            advertising, embedded
            videos and other content, social media interactivity and surveys, and these providers may use cookies,
            web beacons, and other storage technologies to collect or receive information from our Sites and
            elsewhere on the internet. For example, with targeted advertising, we can tailor the delivery and content
            of our ads and other material on our Sites or third party sites and online services, based on previous
            visits
            to our Sites.</p>
          <p class="main-content">The tracking described above may allow online service providers to collect information
            about your
            interaction with our Sites (including IP address) and which they may combine with information they have
            collected at other times and through other sources (e.g. Google may link your activity on multiple devices
            if you have a Google account), or with information we provide them such as email addresses. The use of
            these technologies allows them to help us define target customer groups based on Site usage and
            demographic characteristics (e.g. age, gender) deliver customised advertising content, measure the
            effectiveness of their advertising (e.g. by reporting on the actions people take after viewing particular
            ads), evaluate use of our Sites and other sites and provide other services relating to website activity and
            internet usage.</p>
          <p class="main-content">Those third parties may also transfer the information they collect to others where
            required to do so by
            law, or where those others process the information on their behalf.</p>
          <h2>I. How do we process Children’s Personal Data?</h2>
          <p class="main-content">At MDLZ, we do not believe in marketing directly to children under 12 years of age.
            Therefore our Sites
            are not intended to children under 12 years old.</p>
          <p class="main-content">We also take the protection of children’s privacy seriously; we operate our Sites in
            compliance with all
            applicable law in each corresponding jurisdiction. Individuals who are under age as per the appropriate
            applicable law for each Site for the purpose of providing consent, should have the appropriate
            parent/guardian’s consent as required by local laws before providing any Personal Data to us via the
            website. If we determine upon collection that a user is under age and has not provided the appropriate
            parent/guardian’s consent before providing any Personal Data, we will not use or maintain his/her
            Personal Data without such parent/guardian’s consent. Without such consent, though, the child/individual
            may not be able to participate in certain activities. However, in certain circumstances, we may maintain
            and use such information (in accordance with the rest of this Privacy Notice and applicable law) in order
            to notify and obtain consent from the parent/guardian and for certain safety, security, liability, record
            keeping and other purposes permitted under applicable law. A parent/ guardian can review, remove,
            change or refuse further collection or use of their child’s Personal Data by contacting us as set out in our
            Contact Us section, including child’s name, address and e-mail address.</p>
